# Build Utilities

This package has tools, configuration files and utilities for building,
installing and deploying Clojure projects.


## Usage

This repo, with its set of make files, is to be used on Clojure and Python
build projects like the [NLP parse project].  Scala/sbt make setup is under
development.

- Install [Python 3]
- Install [gitpython]
- For Clojure projects: install [Leiningen] (this is just a script)
- Download (this repo) build system:
```bash
mkdir zenbuild && \
  wget -O - https://api.github.com/repos/plandes/zenbuild/tarball | \
  tar zxfv - -C zenbuild --strip-components 1
