# Build Utilities

This package has tools, configuration files and utilities for building,
installing and deploying projects.


## Usage

This repo, with its set of make files, is to be used on Clojure and Python
build projects like the [NLP parse project].  Scala/sbt make setup is under
development.

## Compiling and Using Build Environment

This repo use to be used as a dependency, and you can too if you want.
However, I've *flipped* the paradigm and now use this repo as a [git module]
since it works well as a tracked version by the parent for each project that
uses it.  Examples:

* [Python project](https://github.com/plandes/zotsite)
* [Clojure](https://github.com/plandes/clj-nlp-parse)

See the [template](https://github.com/plandes/template#usage) project for more
information on use cases and how to use this repo.


## Building and Dependencies

Building a project using this build setup requires certain software to be
installed:

1. Install [GNU make]:

*MacOS*:
```bash
brew install make
```

*Linux (CentOS)*:
```bash
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

2. Install [Git]:

*MacOS*:
```bash
brew install git
```

*Linux (CentOS)*:
```bash
sudo yum install git

3. Install [Python 3]:

*MacOS*:
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install python
```

*Linux (CentOS)*:
```bash
sudo yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
sudo yum -y install python36u
```

4. Install [gitpython]:

```bash
pip install gitpython
```

5. For Clojure projects: install [Leiningen] (this is just a script):
```bash
wget -O /usr/local/bin/lein https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein && chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/lein
```
